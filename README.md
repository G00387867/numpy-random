## An investigation into the numpy.random package.
This repository is an exploration of the routine **numpy.random** within the **NumPy** package. 
The content was created using **Jupyter Notebook** and is structured as follows:

A General introduction to the Numpy Package, its usage and the specific sections of:

> ## Simple Random Data
- integers
- random
- choice
- bytes

> ## Permutations
- shuffle
- permutation

> ## Distributions
- uniform
- normal
- binomial
- pareto
- exponential

> ## Seeds
-  What is Seed
- Pseudo Random vs True Random
- PCG64 vs Mersenne Twister
- How to generate and manipulate seeds for code reproducibility


> ## References

## To run the Jypyter Notebook:
- Initially  you should have no issues to view the contents of the file **`numpy-random.ipynb`** that contains the main body of work.

### If you would like to interact and edit the contents please be advised that you should have the following requirements:

- Download and Install `Anaconda` latest release from it's official and licensed source.
The anaconda package includes the python code and the packages (libraries) needed for the computation and visualisation of the contetnts of the `numpy-random.ipynb` file.
- open the CLI or cmd on the machine
- navigate to the required directory 
- insert `$ git clone _`link of the repository`_
- insert `jupyter notebook'
- a web browser is automatically initiated, where you can see the file `numpy-random.ipynb`
